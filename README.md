# RockPaperScissors2

This is my first JS project - a basic rock, paper, scissors game. This first version will only be playable via the 
browser's console. I will add a basic GUI in the future. 

This game will test my JS knowledge so far, my approach towards projects and my ability to solve projects as they arise.
